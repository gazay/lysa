\s{If A then B; A, therefore B.}

Most people, even most mathematicians, construct proofs by listing off steps. I
sort of do it differently. I'm a huge fan of a concept called the
\term{Curry-Howard correspondence} (this Curry the same guy from Currying).

Instead of stating your proposition, and listing off steps to prove it, I'm
instead going to 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Express what I'm trying to prove via types.
  \item Write a function that fits the type of my proof.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}
    The Curry-Howard correspondence states that

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Types and propositions have identical semantics
      \item Functions and proofs have identical semantics
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

If you have very little math background, that doesn't really seem very
interesting. However, to people who are used to the normal way of proving stuff,
that fact mindblowing.

So, let's say we want to prove that some proposition $a$ implies another
proposition $b$. Well, then, all we have to do is find a function with type

\begin{equation}
    a \implies b
\end{equation}

When dealing with normal non-proofy functions, you can think of the symbol
$\implies$ as saying ``to''. With proofs, it's more helpful to think of the
symbol as ``implies''.

\begin{remark}[Consequence of the Curry-Howard correspondence]
    A value of type $a$, where $a$ is a proposition, is a proof of the
    proposition $a$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Consequence of the Curry-Howard correspondence]
    A function with type $a \implies b$ is a proof that $a$ implies $b$.

    That is, if $a$, then $b$.
\end{remark}

So, how do we disprove something? Well, again, that's not our goal. We instead
want to prove that something isn't provable. That sounds weird, doesn't it?

A staple of logic is called \term{reductio ad absurdum}. It's Latin for
``reduction to the absurd''. Given a proposition $A$, if you can prove that $A$
implies something unprovable, then $A$ is obviously unprovable.

Well, in math, we so happen to have a value that is unprovable. That value is
bottom: $\bot$.

Following along with this logic, if we were to prove that $A$ is unprovable, it
would follow that $A$ implies $\bot$. So, how do we say ``$A$ is unprovable''.

\begin{definition}[Unprovability]
    A proposition $a$ is unprovable if $\lnot a$
\end{definition}

What if you have a proof of both $\lnot A$ and $A$? Well, that's absurd, so
let's call that an instance of reductio ad absurdum.

\begin{definition}[Unprovability by reductio ad absurdum]
    \begin{equation}
        \lnot A = A \implies \bot
    \end{equation}

    That is, proving $\lnot A$ is equivalent to proving that $A \implies \bot$.
\end{definition}

\ss{The big pitfall of propositional logic}

A common mistake is to say ``Well, if $A$ happens, then $B$ will happen. If I
know that $B$ happened, then I can reasonably conclude that $A$ happened at some
point in the past.'' Let's go through an example to show why this doesn't quite
work.

If someone is decapitated, then they are dead, at least within a few seconds.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:decapdead}
    \text{Decapitated} \implies \text{Dead}
\end{equation}

However, if someone is dead, it doesn't necessarily mean they were
decapitated. They could have been shot, stabbed, had a heart attack, been hit by
a bus; there are endless possibilities. Thus,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:notdeaddecap}
    \text{Decapitated} \notimpliedby \text{Dead}
\end{equation}

\ss{The contraposition}

If someone is alive (i.e. \xtb{not} dead), then they obviously weren't
decapitated. Therefore,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:notdeaddecap}
    \lnot\text{Decapitated}\impliedby\lnot\text{Dead}
\end{equation}

This is a fundamental rule of logic, called the \term{contraposition} (or,
marginally more pretentiously, \term{modus tollens}). We can actually prove it
fairly easily.

\begin{lemma}[Contraposition]
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:contraposition}
        \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{\lnot B \implies \lnot A}
    \end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{alignedmath}
        f: \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{\lnot B \implies \lnot A} \\
        f: \parens{A \implies B} \implies \lnot B \implies \lnot A \\
    \end{alignedmath}

    Remember that

    \begin{equation}
        \lnot X = X \implies \bot
    \end{equation}

    If we make this substitution on the last two types:

    \begin{rclmath}
        \lnot B & \Longrightarrow & B \implies \bot \\
        \lnot A & \Longrightarrow & A \implies \bot \\
    \end{rclmath}

    Then, the type of $f$ becomes:

    \begin{equation}
        f : \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{B \implies \bot} \implies A \implies \bot \\
    \end{equation}

    Now the proof is as simple as composing the first and second functions:

    \begin{rclmath}
        p \circ \eva{r}{q} & : & A \implies \bot \\
    \end{rclmath}

    The proof $f$ is now pretty easy

    \begin{equation}
        \eva{f}{p,q} = \eva{r}{q} \circ p
    \end{equation}
\end{proof}

Alright, that was pretty hard! I can almost guarantee you didn't understand that
the first time. It's an entirely new concept!

Go take a coffee break, take a walk, or something of the like, come back in an
hour, and read over the explanation again. I bet it'll be a lot easier to
understand the second time around.

I'm even going to manually insert a page break so you aren't as tempted to keep
going.

\ss{Examples}

Here are some examples of proving stuff!

\begin{example}
    Prove that

    \begin{equation}
        A \implies \lnot \parens{\lnot A}
    \end{equation}

    Substitute $\lnot x \Longrightarrow x \to \bot$.

    \begin{alignedmath}
        A \implies \lnot \parens{A \to \bot} \\
        A \implies \parens{\parens{A \implies \bot} \implies \bot} \\
        A \implies \parens{A \implies \bot} \implies \bot \\
    \end{alignedmath}

    The proof of this is then

    \begin{equation}
        \fn{x,f}{\eva{f}{x}}
    \end{equation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Prove that

    \begin{equation}
        \lnot \parens{\lnot A} \notimplies A
    \end{equation}

    Rather, I am proving that

    \begin{equation}
        \lnot \parens{\lnot \parens{\lnot A} \implies A}
    \end{equation}

    Which is equivalent to 

    \begin{equation}
        \parens{\parens{\parens{A \implies \bot} \implies \bot} \implies A} \implies \bot
    \end{equation}

\end{example}
