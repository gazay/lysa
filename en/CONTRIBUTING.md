## Getting set up

### Installing the needed software

This is separated by operating system. At the moment, LYSA has only been
built on Linux and BSD. I haven't tried OS X or Windows, simply because
I don't have access to them.

*   **Arch**: Open a terminal, run the following command

        sudo pacman -S git texlive-bibtexextra texlive-fontsextra \
            texlive-latexextra texlive-langextra

*   **Gentoo**: Run this command in a terminal:

        sudo emerge -jav dev-vcs/git dev-tex/biblatex \ 
            dev-texlive/texlive-latexrecommended \

    **Warning**: This will spawn a ton of processes, but will make the
    build a lot faster (from several hours to a few minutes). If your
    memory is precious, use `-av` instead of `-jav`.

*   **Debian <7**: The version of TeXLive is too old to build LYSA. You
    need at least TeXLive 2014. The version shipping with Wheezy (Debian
    7) is TexLive 2012.

*   **Debian >=8**: Run this in a terminal:

        sudo aptitude install git texlive-bibtex-extra \
            texlive-fonts-extra texlive-latex-extra texlive-latex-recommended \
            texlive-math-extra 
        tlmgr init-usertree
        tlmgr --usermode install newtxmf

*   **FreeBSD**: I haven't been able to build LYSA on FreeBSD, but I'm
    not a FreeBSD expert. Here's what I tried:

        sudo pkg install texlive-full git
        tlmgr --usermode init-usertree
        tlmgr --usermode install newtxmf

*   **Ubuntu <= 12.04**: Run this command in a terminal:

        sudo aptitude install biblatex texlive texlive-latex-extra \
         texlive-bibtex-extra texlive-math-extra texlive-latex3

    I'm sorry, but I couldn't come up with a longer command.

*   **Ubuntu > 12.04**: Run this in a terminal:

        sudo aptitude install texlive-latex-extra texlive-bibtex-extra \
          texlive-latex3 texlive-fonts-recommended

### Cloning & Building

Run these commands in a terminal

        git clone https://github.com/learnyou/lysa.git
        cd lysa
        git submodule init
        git submodule update
        cd en/book
        ./lysabuild

I don't use Windows, so I don't know how to build LYSA on
Windows. Sorry. If you know how, don't be shy to add instructions!

## If you've never used Git

[git](https://git-scm.herokuapp.com) is a version control
system. Basically, it allows us to have logs of the changes people make
to LYSA. git has a legendarily poor interface, so don't feel bad if you
have a hard time using it. Despite its poor interface, it is actually a
very nice program, which is why everybody uses it.

I highly recommend reading [Chapter 2 of the Git book][gitch2] if you
haven't already, because it covers basic configuration and usage of
Git. 

Ideally, you would read the entire book, but I don't think anyone is
actually going to do that.

## Adding Content

The English version of the book is written in a markup language called
[LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX). LaTeX is pretty easy, so
you can probably pick it up just from reading the source for the
book. If you have any trouble, consult that link.

If you add a substantial amount of new content, such as a new chapter,
or a new section, please feel free to add yourself to the `\author`
field in `book/lysa.ltx` (you don't have to, if you don't want to). If
you suggested changes, or made a number of trivial changes, you can add
yourself to the `\editors` field.

For a more thorough guide to the LaTeX practices I use (including the
file hierarchy), see [`STYLE.md`](STYLE.md)

### Graphs and Code

* For the time being, you can generate a graph with anything you want,
  as long as it's open-source. You just have to include the code to
  generate the graph (in case we want to change it). I recommend
  [Sage][sage].

* Code examples should be written with Sage, though.

### Committing

Try to make sure that each commit only contains one change. It's a lot
less annoying to have to sift through 20 commits each with 1 different
change than 1 commit with 20 different changes. If the change is
difficult to summarize in one line, then you should probably split up
the commit with `git add -p`.

When in doubt, follow the
[Erlang OTP Git Commit Guide](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages).
