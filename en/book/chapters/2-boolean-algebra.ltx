Math is based upon logic. This chapter explains the formal logic I use in this
book. Even if you are familiar with formal logic, I recommend that you read this
chapter simply because every book uses different notation.

I use especially weird notation. I happen to be a fan of a mathematical concept
called the \term{Curry-Howard correspondence}, which calls for my somewhat
unorthodox notation.

\s{Let's get started!}

First of all, you are probably used to statements in logic being either `true',
or `false'. In math, that doesn't really work, because of something called
\term{G\"odel's incompleteness theorem}.

\xtb{What's a theorem?}

It's something in math that is proven. It's a fact.

\xtb{Why don't you just say fact?}

Theorems are based around combining \term{axioms} and other theorems
together. So, they aren't really facts, in the sense that we can only prove them
if you accept other things (the axioms) as facts.

For instance, you can only prove that $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$, for all $a$,
$b$, and $c$ if you accept that $1$ is a number. ``$1$ is a number'' is an
example of an axiom.

G\"odel's incompleteness theorem says that in any non-trivial mathematical
system, there will always be non-axiomatic statements (that is, statements that
aren't axioms) in the system that are true, but unprovable. Another guy, I can't
remember his name, proved that some statements can't even be said to be true or
false.

Because of this problem, you're supposed to think of statements as being
\term{provable} or \term{unprovable}. I might accidentally use the terms `true'
and `false' on accident. Please report instances of this in the \bugtracker\ or
\emailme .

\ss{Implications}

The first symbol is $\implies$. The most common form is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:a-implies-b}
A \implies B
\end{equation}

This should be read as ``$A$ implies $B$''. Sometimes, you'll see something like:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:a-implies-b}
    f : A \implies B
\end{equation}

Which means ``$f$ is a proof that $A$ implies $B$''.

With $\implies$, the prefix (the $A$ in that example) is a proposition, as is
$B$. (They are both propositions).

$f$ is also a proposition. Think of $f$ as a guy saying ``if you can prove $A$
to me, I can prove to you $B$''. 

\xtb{What if I can show that $A$ is unprovable? Does that mean that $B$ is
  unprovable?}

No. The opposite is true, though. That is, if you have a proof:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:contraposition}
    f : A \implies B
\end{equation}

Then there is another proof

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:a-implies-b}
    g : \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{\lnot B \implies \lnot A}
\end{equation}

$\lnot X$ just means ``$X$ is unprovable''. It should be read ``not $X$''

\xtb{Wait, the proof implies another proof? That's confusing.}

Yep. Think of $g$ as a guy saying ``if you give me a proof of that $A \implies
B$, then I can give you a proof that $B \implies A$''.

Or, in more colloquial terms: if $A$ implies $B$, then $\lnot B$ implies
$\lnot A$.
