\s{If A then B; A, therefore B.}

This is pretty simple notation, actually.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:aimpliesb}
    A \implies B
\end{equation}

The above is pretty intuitive: if $A$ is true, then $B$ is true.

The $\implies$ symbol is usually pronounced ``implies''. So, $A$ implies $B$.
Note that this \xtb{does not} mean that $B$ implies $A$.

Now, actually, you shouldn't say true or false. Let's try that again

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:aimpliesb}
    A \implies B
\end{equation}

This proof is a guy sitting around saying ``if you have a proof of $A$, I'll
give you back a proof of $B$''. 

\ss{Reductio ad absurdum}

This is your first instance of mathematicians using fancy Latin-speak to make
you feel stupid. \term{Reductio ad absurdum} is Latin for ``reduction to the
absurd''.

It's an argument where you can disprove $A$ by proving that $A$ implies
something unprovable.

In math, there's a value, which stands for `unprovable'. I mentioned it a few
paragraphs ago. Do you remember what it is?

It's $\bot$. If you can prove $\bot$, which is unprovable, that's absurd, and
your argument is obviously wrong!

So, if you want to prove that a proposition is unprovable, the formal way is to
prove that it implies $\bot$.

That is, for any $A$

\begin{equation}
   \lnot A \implies \parens{A \implies \bot}
\end{equation}

The expression $\lnot A$ should be read ``not A'', or ``A is unprovable''. That
is, a proof of $\lnot A$ is a proof that $A \implies \bot$. $A \implies \bot$ is
obviously not provable, therefore $\lnot A$ is not provable.

\begin{asidebox}
    The rules we've learned so far. Also some rules that we haven't learned
    formally, but should be reasonably obvious.

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item For any proposition $A$, $A \implies A$. This says that ``given a
        proposition, if you have a proof of it, you have a proof of it''. It's
        not all that interesting.
      \item For any propositions $A$, $B$, and $C$, if $A \implies B$ and
        $B \implies C$, then $A \implies C$.

        I can put this into fancy parentheses for you:

        \begin{equation}
            \parens{A \implies B}
            \implies
            \parens{
                \parens{B \implies C}
                \implies
                \parens{A \implies C}
            }
        \end{equation}

        This should be read ``A proof that $A \implies B$ implies that a proof
        of $B \implies C$ implies that $A \implies C$.
  \item For all $A$, $\bot \implies A$.
  \item Therefore, for some $A$, a proof that $A \implies \bot$, means that $A$
    implies everything. This is called ``reductio ad absurdum''. $\lnot A$ is
    equivalent to saying $A \implies \bot$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{asidebox}

\ss{The contraposition}

A common mistake is to say ``Well, if $A$ happens, then $B$ will happen. If I
know that $B$ happened, then I can reasonably conclude that $A$ happened at some
point in the past.''

Let's go through an example to show why this doesn't quite work.

If someone is decapitated, then they are dead, at least within a few seconds.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:decapdead}
    \text{Decapitated} \implies \text{Dead}
\end{equation}

\answergraph{alas-poor-yorick-5.png}

However, if someone is dead, it doesn't necessarily mean they were
decapitated. They could have been shot, stabbed, had a heart attack, been hit by
a bus; there are endless possibilities. Thus,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:notdeaddecap}
    \text{Decapitated} \notimpliedby \text{Dead}
\end{equation}

However, if someone is \xtb{not} dead, then they obviously weren't
decapitated. Therefore,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:notdeaddecap}
    \lnot\text{Decapitated}\impliedby\lnot\text{Dead}
\end{equation}

This is a fundamental rule of logic, called the \term{contraposition} (or,
marginally more pretentiously, \term{modus tollens}):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:contraposition}
    \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{\lnot B \implies \lnot A}
\end{equation}

Remember from before where $\lnot A$ means that $A \implies \bot$. Well, let's
go through this, substituting $\lnot A$ with $A \implies \bot$.

\begin{equation}
    \parens{A \implies B}
    \implies
    \parens{
        \parens{B \implies \bot}
        \implies
        \parens{A \implies \bot}
    }
\end{equation}

Well, if $A \implies B$ and $B \implies \bot$, then, by that property above:
$A \implies \bot$. This is unprovable, so therefore, if $A \implies B$, and $B$
is unprovable, then $A$ is also unprovable.

\ss{An example of a proof}

In some cases, such as the decapitation + death example, it's pretty obvious
that $A$ implies $B$ However, in most cases, it's not obvious. In which case,
you need to provide a \term{proof}. Now, how do you prove something in math?

It's not all that hard usually. You state what you know, and then you combine
those facts together.

Let's look through the proof of the \term{transitive property of logic}.

\begin{textmath}
    For all propositions $A$, $B$, and $C$:

    \begin{equation}
        \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{\parens{B \implies C} \implies \parens{A \implies C}}
    \end{equation}

    Instead of writing ``for all'', most mathematicians will use the symbol
    $\forall$. It sort of looks like an $A$, and it's much more convenient to
    write than typing out ``for all'' every time. The above proposition should
    now be written 

    \begin{equation}
        \forall A, B, C
        \semic
        \parens{A \implies B}
        \implies
        \parens{
          \parens{B \implies C}
          \implies
          \parens{A \implies C}
        }
    \end{equation}

    Throughout the book, you will see a block of text begin with \xti{Proof} and
    end with a white box: \qed

    This is standard mathematical notation. The white box means ``proof
    completed''. You'll often see the term QED floated around a lot. It's an
    acronym for quod erat demonstrandum, which means ``end of demonstration'' in
    Latin. Again, mathematicians love to use fancy Latin phrases to make
    themselves look smart.
\end{textmath}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{equation}
        \forall A, B, C
        \semic
        \parens{A \implies B}
        \implies
        \parens{
          \parens{B \implies C}
          \implies
          \parens{A \implies C}
        }
    \end{equation}

    For giggles, let's give the proof a name: $X$ We don't know what $X$ is yet,
    but we know that it's a proof that
    \(\forall A, B, C \semic \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{\parens{B
        \implies C} \implies \parens{A \implies C}}\)

    To express this, you have the colon ($:$) at your disposal

    \begin{equation}
        X :
        \forall A, B, C
        \semic
        \parens{A \implies B}
        \implies
        \parens{
          \parens{B \implies C}
          \implies
          \parens{A \implies C}
        }
    \end{equation}

    Think about this: $\parens{A \implies B} \implies \dots$. This is equivalent
    to saying ``if I have a proof of $\parens{A \implies B}$, then I can get a
    proof of \dots''. So, we can therefore give the proof of
    $\parens{A \implies B}$ an arbitrary name, and use that arbitrary proof of
    $\parens{A \implies B}$ to prove whatever is in the $\dots$

    \begin{alignedmath}
        f : A \implies B \\
        \hrulefill \\
        \parens{B \implies C} \implies \parens{A \implies C}
    \end{alignedmath}

    On the stuff below the line, we're trying to prove $\parens{A \implies C}$
    assuming that somewhere we have a proof that $\parens{B \implies C}$. We're
    doing the same thing as above essentially. Therefore, we can put
    $\parens{B \implies C}$ above the line.
    
    \begin{alignedmath}
        f : A \implies B \\
        g: B \implies C \\
        \hrulefill \\
        A \implies C \\
    \end{alignedmath}

    We can do the same thing again:

    \begin{alignedmath}
        f : A \implies B \\
        g : B \implies C \\
        h : A \\
        \hrulefill \\
        C \\
    \end{alignedmath}

    $C$ doesn't have any arrows, so it looks like we have to prove $C$. We can't
    just move it above the line!

    Well, $f$ is sitting there hoping that there's a proof of $A$ laying around
    so that it can prove $B$.

    Oh wait, there is!

    So, we can feed $f$ (a proof that $A \implies B$) our proof of $A$ (which is
    $h$). How do we express this notion of ``feeding''?

    \begin{alignedmath}
        f : A \implies B \\
        g : B \implies C \\
        h : A \\
        \eva{f}{h} : B \\
        \hrulefill \\
        C \\
    \end{alignedmath}

    There we go! Now, we have a proof of $B$ at our disposal. We can use it to
    prove $C$ by feeding our proof of $B$ to the proof that $B \implies C$!

    \begin{alignedmath}
        f : A \implies B \\
        g : B \implies C \\
        h : A \\
        \eva{f}{h} : B \\
        \eva{g}{\eva{f}{h}} : C \\
        \hrulefill \\
        C \\
    \end{alignedmath}

    Yay, we have the same thing above the line as below the line! So, we're done!
\end{proof}

Alright, that was pretty hard! I can almost guarantee you didn't understand that
the first time. It's an entirely new concept!

Go take a coffee break, take a walk, or something of the like, come back in an
hour, and read over the explanation again. I bet it'll be a lot easier to
understand the second time around.

I'm even going to manually insert a page break so you aren't as tempted to keep
going.
