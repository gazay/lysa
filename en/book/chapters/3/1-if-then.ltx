\s{If A then B; A, therefore B.}

Hi, everyone! This is the first real bit of math in this book! Hold on to your
bootstraps!

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:aimpliesb}
    A \implies B
\end{equation}

Mathematicians aren't great at inventing intuitive notation. This one is pretty
good though: if $A$, then $B$

The $\implies$ symbol is usually pronounced ``implies''. So, $A$ implies $B$.
Note that this \xtb{does not} mean that $B$ implies $A$.

\xtb{It is vitally important that you do not think of these propositions as
  being true or false}. Instead, they are `provable' and `not provable'. 

A common mistake is to say ``Well, if $A$ happens, then $B$ will happen. If I
know that $B$ happened, then I can reasonably conclude that $A$ happened at some
point in the past.''

This is essentially saying

\begin{alignmath}{rl}
               & A \implies B \\
               & B \\
    \therefore & A \\
\end{alignmath}
    
The symbol $\therefore$ is short for ``therefore''. I don't have a clever way to
remember it. You'll likely get used to it, though.

Let's go through an example to show why this doesn't quite work.

If someone is decapitated, then they are dead, at least within a few seconds.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:decapdead}
    \text{Decapitated} \implies \text{Dead}
\end{equation}

However, if someone is dead, it doesn't necessarily mean they were
decapitated. They could have been shot, stabbed, had a heart attack, been hit by
a bus; there are endless possibilities. Thus,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:notdeaddecap}
    \text{Decapitated} \notimpliedby \text{Dead}
\end{equation}

However, if someone is \xtb{not} dead, then they obviously weren't
decapitated. Therefore,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:notdeaddecap}
    \lnot\text{Decapitated}\impliedby\lnot\text{Dead}
\end{equation}

This is a fundamental rule of logic, called the \term{contraposition} (or,
marginally more pretentiously, \term{modus tollens}):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:contraposition}
    \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{\lnot B \implies \lnot A}
\end{equation}

Remember from before where $\lnot A$ means that $A \implies \bot$. Well, let's
go through this, substituting $\lnot A$ with $A \implies \bot$.

\begin{equation}
    \parens{A \implies B}
    \implies
    \parens{
        \parens{B \implies \bot}
        \implies
        \parens{A \implies \bot}
    }
\end{equation}

Well, if $A \implies B$ and $B \implies \bot$, then, by that property above:
$A \implies \bot$. This is unprovable, so therefore, if $A \implies B$, and $B$
is unprovable, then $A$ is also unprovable.

\ss{An example of a proof}

In some cases, such as the decapitation + death example, it's pretty obvious
that $A$ implies $B$ However, in most cases, it's not obvious. In which case,
you need to provide a \term{proof}. Now, how do you prove something in math?

It's not all that hard usually. You state what you know, and then you combine
those facts together.

Let's look through the proof of the \term{transitive property of logic}.

\begin{textmath}
    For all propositions $A$, $B$, and $C$:

    \begin{equation}
        \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{\parens{B \implies C} \implies \parens{A \implies C}}
    \end{equation}

    Instead of writing ``for all'', most mathematicians will use the symbol
    $\forall$. It sort of looks like an $A$, and it's much more convenient to
    write than typing out ``for all'' every time. The above proposition should
    now be written 

    \begin{equation}
        \forall A, B, C
        \semic
        \parens{A \implies B}
        \implies
        \parens{
          \parens{B \implies C}
          \implies
          \parens{A \implies C}
        }
    \end{equation}

    Throughout the book, you will see a block of text begin with \xti{Proof} and
    end with a white box: \qed

    This is standard mathematical notation. The white box means ``proof
    completed''. You'll often see the term QED floated around a lot. It's an
    acronym for quod erat demonstrandum, which means ``end of demonstration'' in
    Latin. Again, mathematicians love to use fancy Latin phrases to make
    themselves look smart.
\end{textmath}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{equation}
        \forall A, B, C
        \semic
        \parens{A \implies B}
        \implies
        \parens{
          \parens{B \implies C}
          \implies
          \parens{A \implies C}
        }
    \end{equation}

    For giggles, let's give the proof a name: $X$ We don't know what $X$ is yet,
    but we know that it's a proof that
    \(\forall A, B, C \semic \parens{A \implies B} \implies \parens{\parens{B
        \implies C} \implies \parens{A \implies C}}\)

    To express this, you have the colon ($:$) at your disposal

    \begin{equation}
        X :
        \forall A, B, C
        \semic
        \parens{A \implies B}
        \implies
        \parens{
          \parens{B \implies C}
          \implies
          \parens{A \implies C}
        }
    \end{equation}

    Think about this: $\parens{A \implies B} \implies \dots$. This is equivalent
    to saying ``if I have a proof of $\parens{A \implies B}$, then I can get a
    proof of \dots''. So, we can therefore give the proof of
    $\parens{A \implies B}$ an arbitrary name, and use that arbitrary proof of
    $\parens{A \implies B}$ to prove whatever is in the $\dots$

    \begin{alignedmath}
        f : A \implies B \\
        \hrulefill \\
        \parens{B \implies C} \implies \parens{A \implies C}
    \end{alignedmath}

    On the stuff below the line, we're trying to prove $\parens{A \implies C}$
    assuming that somewhere we have a proof that $\parens{B \implies C}$. We're
    doing the same thing as above essentially. Therefore, we can put
    $\parens{B \implies C}$ above the line.
    
    \begin{alignedmath}
        f : A \implies B \\
        g: B \implies C \\
        \hrulefill \\
        A \implies C \\
    \end{alignedmath}

    We can do the same thing again:

    \begin{alignedmath}
        f : A \implies B \\
        g : B \implies C \\
        h : A \\
        \hrulefill \\
        C \\
    \end{alignedmath}

    $C$ doesn't have any arrows, so it looks like we have to prove $C$. We can't
    just move it above the line!

    Well, $f$ is sitting there hoping that there's a proof of $A$ laying around
    so that it can prove $B$.

    Oh wait, there is!

    So, we can feed $f$ (a proof that $A \implies B$) our proof of $A$ (which is
    $h$). How do we express this notion of ``feeding''?

    \begin{alignedmath}
        f : A \implies B \\
        g : B \implies C \\
        h : A \\
        \eva{f}{h} : B \\
        \hrulefill \\
        C \\
    \end{alignedmath}

    There we go! Now, we have a proof of $B$ at our disposal. We can use it to
    prove $C$ by feeding our proof of $B$ to the proof that $B \implies C$!

    \begin{alignedmath}
        f : A \implies B \\
        g : B \implies C \\
        h : A \\
        \eva{f}{h} : B \\
        \eva{g}{\eva{f}{h}} : C \\
        \hrulefill \\
        C \\
    \end{alignedmath}

    Yay, we have the same thing above the line as below the line! So, we're done!
\end{proof}

Alright, that was pretty hard! I can almost guarantee you didn't understand that
the first time. It's an entirely new concept!

Go take a coffee break, take a walk, or something of the like, come back in an
hour, and read over the explanation again. I bet it'll be a lot easier to
understand the second time around.

I'm even going to manually insert a page break so you aren't as tempted to keep
going.
