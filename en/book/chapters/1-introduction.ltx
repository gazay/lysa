Before I bore you with a bunch of stuff you don't care about, let's do
some math, shall we?

There are essentially three notions with which you need to be familiar
in order to do anything interesting in math. These three things are {\it
sets}, {\it functions}, and {\it proofs}.  Unfortunately, to be familiar
with one, you have to be familiar with the other two.\footnote{You'll
learn as we go along, when math people use a common term like {\it set},
{\it function}, {\it proof}, {\it group}, {\it continuous} or {\it
closed}, they usually mean something similar in concept to the
colloquial term, but there are some strings attached. This is usually
the case in the sciences too (e.g. \xti{theory}, \xti{hypothesis},
\xti{experiment}).}

So, what are each of those things?

\begin{itemize}
\item A \xti{set} is an unordered collection of things. There is also no
repetition. For instance, $\mset{2, 5}$ is the same as $\mset{5, 2}$
(because order doesn't matter). $\mset{2, 5, 5}$ would be the same set,
because there's no notion of multiplicity.

You see what I did there? I subtly introduced some notation: the bracket
notation for sets. This math stuff really isn't all that difficult. It's
also really interesting if you approach it the right way.

\item A \xti{function} is a mathematical construct (well, obviously,
else I wouldn't be talking about it). Basically, it takes some input,
does something to it, and spits out some output. If you give the
function the same input a bunch of times, you should get the same result
each time. This concept is called ``referential transparency.'' If the
function is not referentially transparent, then it's not a
function. It's something else.

\item A \xti{proof} is basically where you take a bunch of simple facts,
called \xti{axioms}, and chain them together to make
\xti{theorem}s. It's sort of like sticking puzzle pieces together to
form a picture.

The puzzle pieces (in this case, the axioms) aren't usually very
interesting on their own. However, the picture they form (in this case,
the theorem) can be really cool and enlightening. The proof would be
analogous to an explicit set of instructions explaining how to put the
pieces together.
\end{itemize}

Once you are familiar with each of those concepts, we can do all sorts
of cool stuff. Throughout the book, we will prove all of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item If you tap your finger against a bridge at exactly the right
frequency, the bridge will collapse. (Resonance)
\item The formula used to calculate the interest rate on your mortgage
is actually just a fancy form of the ratios of angles in a
triangle. (Euler's formula)
\end{itemize}

\s{How to read the book}

The best way to read this book is to just read it. Don't skip sections,
or look ahead, or anything like that. Just read it straight
through. It's also pretty important that you read the rest of this
chapter. I promise it's not too boring.

Do all of the exercises. There aren't that many. However, they are
pretty difficult. The exercises all have solutions, which are in
\cref{ex-solutions}.

The exercises are designed to make you think, and widen your perspective
on the topic at hand. They are not designed to be tedious. They are
difficult, but the good kind of difficult.

It would be perfectly okay to just do the exercises (all of them), and
then go back and read the text when you don't understand something.

\Cref{appendix-d} is a reference section. It contains every single
theorem, definition, identity, and property in this book. Unlike the
contents of this book, \cref{appendix-d} is not meant to be read
straight through. However, if you don't remember the name of something,
or want to know if some property is true, \cref{appendix-d} is the place
to look.


My writing strategy involves writing the bare minimum information, with
criminally few examples or exercises, so I can get the structure right,
then to go back and fill in the blanks. So, until this book is finished,
it's going to be horrifyingly fast paced.

\s{Introduction (for real this time)}\label{real-intro}

This is a math book. Well, duh. Why did I write it?

Most math (and science) books nowadays seem to value keeping an academic
tone over ensuring that the reader understands the material, and ---
more importantly --- enjoys reading the book.

I take the opposite approach. I want to create a book that is fun to
read and easy to understand, while eschewing the practice of making
myself look good.

In high school, and even in college, I noticed that subjects were taught
with pragmatism in mind: here's what you need to learn to have a job
doing X.  It completely zaps the intellectual curiosity of the
students. I think that's a shame. I hope reading this book will rekindle
your intellectual curiosity.

The inspiration for this book is
\href{http://learnyouahaskell.com/}{{\it Learn You a Haskell for Great
Good!}, by Miran Lipovaƒça}. Haskell is a programming language, and LYAH
is a great book for learning Haskell. If you are interested in a print
copy of LYAH, see \cite{lyah}.

\ss{Programming}

In this book, I cover a lot of hard stuff.\footnote{This isn't actually
true. Math isn't hard, stupid!} Sometimes, it's useful to program your
way through a problem. You don't have to, but it helps. Every programmer
will tell you that programming teaches a manner of thinking.

Many programmers will cite Steve Jobs's\footnote{For you youngsters,
Steve Jobs is the former CEO of Apple. He's dead now.} famous quote,
regarding the use of programming in his job,

\begin{iquote}
[sic] \ldots much more importantly, it had nothing to do with using [the
programs we wrote] for anything practical. It had to do with using them
to be a mirror of your thought process; to actually learn how to
think. I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a
computer --- should learn a computer language --- because it teaches you
how to think.
\end{iquote}

\nocite{jobs-programming}

That first sentence or two is actually a pretty good description of
mathematics (and programming). Both are incredibly useful, and have
endless practical applications.

That's not the point, though. The whole usefulness thing is a side
gig. It's about learning how to think, and having a rigorous language
through which to express your thoughts.

Furthermore, the rigor of the language helps you build upon your current
thoughts to find out even cooler things. That's what math (and
programming) is about.

\link{http://www.sagemath.org/}{Sage} is a mathematically-oriented
programming language. If you're familiar with Mathematica or Maple, Sage
is a libre alternative.

Sage is perhaps most useful in generating graphs transparently. Sage is
also capable of solving your equations, finding holes in your logic, the
whole 9 yards. 

I would include instructions for installing Sage. However, it takes up a
lot of space, and my instructions would quickly be obselete. You can
find better instructions for installing Sage on
\link{http://wiki.sagemath.org/DownloadAndInstallationGuide}{their
website}.

\s{The community}

Despite the fact that I used ``I'' in the first part of the book, LYSA
is actually a community project, and many people participate in the
writing of this book.

If you want to talk to us, or to other math people, come see us in {\tt
\#lysa} on Freenode. If you don't know what IRC is, or you don't have a
client set up, you can connect through
\link{http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=lysa}{Freenode's webchat}.

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the
IRC channel ({\tt \#lysa} on FreeNode in case you forgot).

If you want to submit a correction, or have some issue, or want to add
some content, really anything having to do with the content of the book,
you can visit \link{https://github.com/learnyou/lysa}{our GitHub
page}. We also have a \link{http://learnyou.org}{woefully incomplete
website} and a \link{https://lysa.reddit.com/}{community on Reddit}.

\s{Target audience}

The explanation of why programming is useful is a good segue into
discussing the target audience.

When I was first writing the book, I wrote it in an effort to strengthen
my own understanding. So, the target audience was me. The very first
versions of this book were about a abstractish branch of math called
commutative algebra. Later on, it seemed more fitting to abstractly go
over the basics of math. That's what the current version of the book
does.

That doesn't answer the question: who is the target audience? Well,
people who want to learn basic and intermediate algebra, and to learn
why it's so interesting.

I mentioned this in \cref{real-intro}. Most books (and people) treat
math as a tool you can use for calculations. I treat math as a language
you can use to express your ideas. That's the core difference.  This
book will hopefully give you an interest in math itself, rather than
just a cursory knowledge of it.

With that in mind, my book is going to approach the topics much
differently than other books on the same topic. I rely very much on
abstraction and intuition.

It's that you know all of the basics about arithmetic: you should know
how to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and exponentiate. You should
also be familiar with the following sets, although it's not really hard
to pick up:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\N \ce \mset{0,1,2,3,4, \dots }$
\item $\Z \ce \mset{\dots, \ng{4}, \ng{3}, \ng{2}, \ng{1}, 0,1,2,3,4, \dots }$
\item The real numbers $\R$.
\item The rational numbers $\Q$.
\item The irrational numbers $\I \ce \R \bs \Q$.
\item The complex numbers $\C$.
\end{enumerate}

If not, you should look at
\cref{basic-arithmetic}. \Cref{basic-arithmetic} is more or less a
blatant ripoff of \cite{landau-analysis}. I would like to think that my
appendix is much less dry, and does a bit more in the explaining
department. Landau's wonderful book is very dry. It's just theorem after
theorem after theorem. It's very rigorous, but you'll fall asleep after
reading a page.

\s{Licensing}

This book is libre.\footnote{\xti{Libre} is a French word, which,
translated to English, means \xti{free} in the sense of liberty, as
opposed to price. Think \xti{free speech}, not \xti{free beer}.} You can
copy this book and give it to your friend. You can even print it out and
sell it to people.\footnote{There are some restrictions though, see
\cref{gfdl}.}

If, for instance, you are a schoolteacher and want to use this for your
class, you are free to edit it to your liking and give the modified copy
to your students. The only string I attach is, you have to allow anyone
to whom you give the book do the same thing (i.e. they have to be free
to copy/modify/change your version). The details of this can be found in
\cref{gfdl}.

LYSA is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License. \Cref{gfdl}
contains the license. Please read the license; it's actually pretty
comprehensible.

you are looking to contribute, it's probably best to clone the git
repository. You can clone the git repository by running \terminal{git

\s{Conventions used throughout}

You don't actually have to read this section, but it would be useful.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \code{Things in monospace} are either code snippets or commands to
be run in a terminal. I have separate stylings for \terminal{terminal
commands} and \code{inline code snippets}. That said, they are separate
but equal, at least for the time being.
\item The \S\ symbol refers to a section. So \S\ 3.2 means ``chapter 3,
section 2''.
\item Even though most of the writers are American, I still use the
British convention of putting periods after quotation marks: ``like
this''. The British convention is less ambiguous. If you see the
American convention anywhere in this book, please report it.
\item I will often recommend software. However, I will not recommend any
non-libre software, or any software that costs money.
\item ``I'' refers to me. ``We'' refers to both me and you, the
reader. ``You'' refers to, you guessed it, the reader. It's the
convention in academia to use the so-called ``royal we'', such as ``we
subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to obtain the result \dots''.

Sometimes, we will accidentally use the royal we, out of habit. Crap, I
just did it there! See? It's very difficult to avoid. Like any of the
other conventions herein, if you see it broken, please report the error
to the authors. You can use the \bugtracker, or, if you don't want to
make a gratis GitHub account, you can \emailme.

\item Oh yeah, sometimes I'll use \code{monospace} in things like URLs
or emails for the sake of disambiguity.

\item Most of the authors use some version of Linux. Hence, when there
are instructions for computer things (such as installing Haskell), I'll
write instructions for Linux, because that's what I know. There are two
solutions here:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item You could try out Linux (it's gratis, and it's easy).
  \item If you know how to do the thing on your OS, and there aren't
  instructions for your OS, you could write up instructions and add them
  to the book. If you don't know how to do that, you could bring it up
  in the \bugtracker\ or \emailme.
  \end{enumerate}

\item If you see some number as a superscript in the middle of text:
like this\footnote{Hey, you found me!}, then the number refers to a
footnote. If the superscript number is in the middle of math, it's
probably just math.

\item If there's some number in brackets, like this: \cite{lyah}, then
it's a citation. If you're reading this as a PDF, you can actually click
on the number, and your PDF reader will take you to the relevant
bibliography entry. Go ahead, check it out! I'll wait. You can do the
same thing for footnotes and URLs.\footnote{Well, clicking the URL will
open up your web browser, but you get the point}

\label{conventions}
\item If you see something \term{in italics}, it's usually a vocabulary
word. Often there will be a term with a section number next to it:
\termref{like this}{d-equality}, usually somewhere in
\cref{appendix-d}. \Cref{appendix-d} is a reference section, which has
theorems, vocabulary, identities, stuff like that. So, the reference to
a section in \cref{appendix-d} next to a term points to the relevant
section in the appendix. Like all of the other references --- citations,
footnotes, URLs --- you can click on the section title, and your PDF
reader will take you there.
\end{enumerate}
