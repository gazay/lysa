\s{The community}

Despite the fact that I used ``I'' in the first part of the book, LYSA
is actually a community project, and many people participate in the
writing of this book.

If you want to talk to us, or to other math people, come see us in {\tt
\#lysa} on Freenode. If you don't know what IRC is, or you don't have a
client set up, you can connect through
\link{http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=lysa}{Freenode's webchat}.

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the
IRC channel ({\tt \#lysa} on FreeNode in case you forgot).

If you want to submit a correction, or have some issue, or want to add
some content, really anything having to do with the content of the book,
you can visit \link{https://github.com/learnyou/lysa}{our GitHub
page}. We also have a \link{http://learnyou.org}{woefully incomplete
website} and a \link{https://lysa.reddit.com/}{community on Reddit}.
