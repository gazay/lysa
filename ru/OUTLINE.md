# Outline

Here's my (pharpend) basic outline for the book. It's extremely rough at this
point and will probably be gutted and slaughtered in its entirety.

* Chapter 1, Introduction
    + Motivation
    + Potential scope of the book
    + What background knowledge you need.
        - ideally this would just be fluency in english, and elementary school math.
    + What is math?
    + Why are we interested in it?

All of the chapters beyond this point will be assumed to have a multitude of
exercises, graphs, examples, applications, etc.

* Chapter 2, Boolean Algebra
    + Introduction
    + Basic Logic
        + True and False
            - \land, \lor, and \lnot
        + Logic notation
            - \implies, \impliedby, \iff
        + Exercises

    + Mildly more complicated Logic
        + Combining All of them
            - \lnot\lnot, \lnot\land
        + More logic notation
            - \notimplies, \notimpliedby, \notiff
        + Exercises 
            - \lnot\lor
    + Idris stuff
        + Do all the previous stuff in Idris.
        

* Chapter 3, Sets
    + Lists and ordered pairs
    + Sets
        + ElementOf
        + ImproperSubset
        + ProperSubset
        + Exercises
    + Operators on Sets
        + Unary opearators
        + Binary operators
        + The set of booleans
            - Unary ~ operator
            - Binary V and ^ operators
            - Binary V and ^ operators
        + Exercises
+ The set of natural numbers
+ The set of integers
+ The set of real numbers


* Chapter 3, Proofs
    + What are proofs?
    + Proof-based approach to groups, rings, fields.
    * Peano axioms
        + Basically go through Landau's Foundations of Analysis

* Chapter 4, Special sets
    + Magmas
    + Semigroups
    + Categories
    + Monoids
    + Groups
    + Rings
    + Fields

* Chapter 5, fancy functions
    + Homomorphisms
    + Isomorphisms
    + Endomorphisms
    + Injective functions
    + Surjective functions
    + Bijective functions

* Chapter 6, monomials
    + Examples
    + How to manipulate them algebraically
    + Graphs of lines

* Chapter 7, polynomials
    + Examples
    + How to manipulate them algebraically
    + Graphs of lines
    + Quadratic formula

Let us make this our goal for now, then we will move on.

* Chapter 8, exponential functions
* Chapter 9, logarithms
* Chapter 10, trig functions

This is a good segue to talk about Complex numbers

* Chapter 11, complex and imaginary numbers
* Chapter 12, Complex functions
* Chapter 13, Complex algorithms

Good segue to talk about the concept of dimensions

* Chapter 14, Dimensions
* Chapter 15, Parametric functions
* Chapter 16, Complex parametric functions
* Chapter 17, functions that go from F^n to F, where F is a field.
* Chapter 18, functions that go from F to F^n, where F is a field.
* Chapter 19, functions that go from F^n to F^m, where F is a field.
                                                         
We'll next want to approach *systems* of equations. first\ matrices

* Chapter 20, Matrices
    + Matrix addition, multiplication, etc
    + Matrices as linear functions

* Chapter 21, Systems of equations
    + What is a system of equations
    + using matrices to solve for them

* Chapter 22, Vector spaces

... Basically go through linear algebra

* Chapter 35, calculus

... Go through calculus and differential equations

<!-- This fixes #1 -->

* Chapter 52, Statistics

* Appendix B - boring stuff
    + Introduction of the primary authors (Peter Harpending, Randy Brown).
    + Book license
    + How to contribute
